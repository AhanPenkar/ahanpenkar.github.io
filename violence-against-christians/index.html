				<p>Pastor Sanjay Bhandari was enjoying dinner with his wife and sister last April when he heard a massive commotion outside his house. To his horror, he saw a violent mob of nearly 60 people baying for his blood. Bhandari and his wife were dragged out of their house, and paraded through the village, Halaga in Karnataka. The mob kicked and assaulted him and his wife till they eventually reached his worship hall. “I don’t know how we are alive,” Bhandari said, “I think there was some divine intervention, or maybe they didn’t think it was appropriate to do something like that in the house of God.” he added. The mob applied vermillion and turmeric on their faces, abused the church and let them go.

				<p>Violence against religious minorities is a part of India’s social fabric, to the extent that these incidents are not considered extraordinary or worthy of coverage. According to the Evangelical Fellowship of India, 2021 saw above five hundred instances of harassment and violence targeting evangelists, and the churchgoing community, making this slightly more than an everyday occurance. Since the election of Narendra Modi in the 2014 general election, religious violence has become a key component of media discourse in the country. The BJPs campaigns and politics often invokes and exacerbates religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims. While Christians are not as much a part of targeted speeches, violence against them has been on the rise as fervent hindu nationalism grows from strength to strength. The Bajrang Dal, a group with very close ties to the BJP has extensively vilified and demonized Indian Christians, particularly in the state of Karnataka.

				<p>After being re-elected for a second term, The BJP has sharpened the religious divide in the country by making discriminatory and exclusionary policies, such as the Citizenship Amendment Act, which excludes Muslims from the list of refugees coming into India, and the National Registry of Citizens. Around 10 states in India, have already passed an anti-conversion law, which aims to regulate religious conversions, and several states have also contemplated amendments to existing laws. Religious conversion (or the anxiety surrounding it) has been a prime driver of hate against christians. Praveen Togadia, the leader of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, one of India’s most notorious and virulent right wing groups proclaimed that all Indians had once been Hindu but were lured away with coercion and enticements. He also promised to make India 100 percent Hindu. Right-wing discourse on social media also refer to Indian christians as “ricebags”, denigrating them as people who converted to christianity for a bag of rice.
